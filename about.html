                            for centuries, down the annals of history, "the cultural cradle of South India". Sanctity,
                            devotion, heritage, reverence and awareness to acquire and cherish the best mark her spirit
                            till date. Caught in her native charm and greatness as though, the Britishers founded a
                            provincial school in the year 1854 on her banks of Cauveri and aptly nick-named the
                            pro-college-school as 'the Cambridge of South India'. As on Cambridge, so on Kumbakonam
                            Cauveri grew the school to fullness and matured into a mini-varsity of learning and research
                            as is witnessed today. Though easy as it might seem, to draw a time-line of the
                            college-history would be very exacting and voluminous a task if undertaken seriously. As one
                            among the first four Indian Educational Institutions started by the British,</p><br>
                        <p class="st2"> since 19th century, the pro-form of that college school was a true precursor to
                            University Education in South India. Government Arts College (Autonomous) Kumbakonam of
                            today with an ancestry dating back to 1854 is far senior and her sesquicentennial is at
                            hand! She is the proud Alma Mater of her Alumni with merit and genius deserving
                            world-renown: Not a few are the names that are on the lips of the learned as and when the
                            college is recalled. Mathematical wizard Srinivasa Ramanujan, Silver-Tongue Srinivasa
